Barracuda WAF for Azure

The Barracuda Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides proven application security and data loss prevention for your applications on Microsoft Azure, including:
  - Detecting and blocking attacks including SQL injections, Cross-Site Scripting, malware uploads, and volumetric or application DDoS.
  - Authentication and access control allowing organizations to exercise strong user control.
  - Scanning of outbound traffic for sensitive data, with admin control of masking or blocking information to prevent data leakage.
  - Built-in load balancing and session management, allowing organizations to manage multiple applications behind a single WAF instance.

Cloud hosted deployment of the Barracuda Web Application Firewall on Microsoft Azure currently supports One-Arm Proxy Mode. 

To meet a variety of performance requirements, the A1, A2, A3 and A4 instance types are supported. Depending on the instance type, you can have:
  - Up to 8 vCPU.
  - Up to 14 GB of memory.
  
The Barracuda Web Application Firewall is available on Microsoft Azure with the Bring Your Own License (BYOL) and Hourly / Metered option:

Bring Your Own License (BYOL)

With the Bring Your Own License (BYOL) option, you are required to get the Barracuda Web Application Firewall license token, either by:
  - Providing the required information for a free evaluation at https://www.barracuda.com/purchase/evaluation OR
  - Purchasing online at https://www.barracuda.com/purchase.

With this license option, there will be no Barracuda Web Application Firewall Software charges, but Microsoft Azure usage charges on Microsoft will be applicable.

You can add multiple Barracuda Web Application Firewall instances under one cloud service and load balance the traffic between the deployed instances to increase the throughput. For more information on load balancing, see the Load Balancing For Clustered Barracuda Web Application Firewall Instances in the Old Microsoft Azure Management Portal article.

Hourly / Metered

With the Hourly/Metered licensing option, you complete the purchase or evaluation of the Barracuda Web Application Firewall entirely within the Microsoft Azure gallery. After the instance is launched, it is provisioned automatically. You are charged hourly for both the Barracuda Web Application Firewall Software and Microsoft Azure usage on Microsoft. 

Hourly / Metered Model and Instance Types
For more information on supported instance types, Default vCPU, Default Memory and Hourly pricing, refer to Barracuda Web Application Firewall Pricing Details. 

If you want to increase the performance of an existing VM, configure it with a larger instance type on Microsoft Azure and you will be charged accordingly by Microsoft. The VM will automatically be reconfigured by Microsoft with the resources and capabilities of the larger instance type.
